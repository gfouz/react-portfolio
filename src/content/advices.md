# How to be a better programmer.

![react wallpaper](./images/advices.jpg)

## Get good at Googling.

Being a programmer is all about learning how to search for
the answers to your questions. By learning to Google things
effectively, you'll save a lot of development time.

## Write useful comments.

Write comments which explain the "why" and not the "what".

## Name variables and functions appropriately.

Functions and variables should accurately denote
their purpose, so myCoolFunction won't fly.

## Take vacations, invest time on other kind of things.

We all need time to de-compress. Take that trip you've been
wanting. Your brain and your co-workers will thank you.

## Delete unused code

No reason to accrue more technical debt.

## Learn to read code

Reading code is an undervalued skill, but an invaluable one.

## Pair program

Pair programming allows you to play the role of both teacher and student.

## Get involved in the community

Surrounding yourself with like-minded people will motivate you to push through the lows.

## Keep learning

You've chosen a profession that requires continuous learning. Learn to love it.

## Don't give up

It won't always be easy. But we all started at the same place. You can do it.

## Take tasks that scare you

If it doesn't scare you, it isn't going to help you grow.

## Learn to love constructive criticism

Ask trusted colleagues and friends for constructive criticism. It will help you grow as a programmer and as a human.

## Be open-minded

Technology changes, and it changes quickly. Don't oppose new technology; learn it and then form an opinion.

## Stay relevant

Stay up-to-date on the latest tech news by following publications, blogs, podcasts, and tech news.

## Focus on problem solving

Strong problem solving skills can conquer any problem. Hone in on what it takes to solve a problem.

## Stay humble

No matter what title you hold or what company you work form, stay humble.

## Learn to debug

Explore the browser debugger tools. Learn the ins-and-outs of debugging with your IDE. By learning the most effective methods for debugging a problem and tracing errors, you'll be able to solve even the most difficult bugs.

## Exercise your current skills

Just because you currently know a skill doesn't mean you shouldn't exercise it. Skills fade with time unless consciously improved upon, and this industry evolves so rapidly it's important to keep practicing. Get out of the mindset that "I've always done it this way" and into the mindset of "Is there a better way to do this?"

## Understand the why

There will be times when you have to voice your opinion, so it's important to understand the why behind it. Why is solution A better than solution B? Provide a valid argument and your opinions will be much more sound.

## Know your worth

You are a commodity, and should be paid appropriately. Be aware of the industry averages in your geographic location. If you're making less money, it's time to have a chat with your manager. Go after what you deserve.

## Don't be afraid to ask for help

If you're stuck on a problem and spending too much time searching for a solution, it's time to ask for help. We're all human. We all need help. There is no shame in reaching out to a colleague for support.

## Learn to learn

People learn in different ways. Some learn best through video tutorials, others through reading a book. Figure out your learning style and practice it diligently.

## Take breaks

It's nearly impossible to spend 8 consecutive hours coding. You'll burn out quickly and make a lot of mistakes. So set a timer to remind yourself to stop and take a break. Go for a walk. Get a coffee with a colleague. Stepping away from the screen will positively impact your productivity and the quality of your work.

## Track your progress

Learning to code takes time and can be extremely disheartening when you don't see progress. So it's important to track your achievements and progress towards your goals. Keep a small list next to your computer and each time you achieve something, write it down, no matter how small. Atomic achievements compound to much larger rewards.

## Don't choose the comfortable technology; choose the right one

Each project will have different needs, and as such we must choose the right tools for the job. Although it's comfortable to choose technologies you've worked with previously, if they don't suit the needs of the project, alternatives should be explored.

## Take responsibility for your mistakes

All humans make mistakes and you will many many throughout your career. Thus it's important to own up and take responsibility when you've made a mistake. It will build trust with your team members and management.

## Learn from your failures

Failure is simply not achieving the expected outcome, and is not necessarily a bad thing. We all have many failures during the course of our careers. Learn from your downfalls. What can you do differently next time?

## Test your code

Tests are important. Unit tests, regression tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests. Test your code and your product will be much more stable.

## Reduce ambiguity

Instead of writing convoluted code which shows off your snazzy programming skills, aim for readability and simplicity. This will make it easier for your team members to contribute.

## Read documentation

Documentation is the purest source of truth about a technology, so learning to read it can quickly help you to become an expert.

## Don't compare yourself to others

The only thing you should compare yourself to is who you were yesterday.

## Apply for jobs you aren't qualified for

You will never meet every requirement for a job. So take a chance and apply! What do you have to lose?

## Learn how to work from home

If you have the ability to work from home, learn to do so effectively. Find a separate office space, devoid of distractions. Boneskull wrote a great article on working from home you should check out.

## Remember why you love programming

You got into this profession because it sparked an interest. If you're getting frustrated and resentful, take a break. Give yourself space to reignite your passion for programming.

## Share your knowledge

If you learn something cool, share it! Present at a local meetup or conference. Teach your coworker or mentee during lunch. Sharing your knowledge reinforces your knowledge while spreading
the wealth.
