## What is React ?

React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook which, among other things, was used to build Instagram.com. Its aim is to allow developers to easily create fast user interfaces for websites and applications alike. The main concept of React.js is virtual DOM. It is a tree based on JavaScript components created with React that mimics a DOM tree. It does the least amount of DOM manipulation possible in order to keep your React components up to date.

## A little of history

Firstly, React was deployed by Facebook in 2011 and 2012. Instagram was written entirely in React. According to JavaScript analytics service Libscore, React is currently being used on the homepages and other web pages of Netflix, Imgur, Bleacher Report, Feedly, Airbnb, SeatGeek, HelloSign, and others.

## Why Use React.js for Web Development?

Being a part of the JavaScript language, using React spawns lots of advantages. Products built with React are simple to scale, a single language used on the server/client/mobile side of things grants outstanding productivity, there are workflow patterns for convenient teamwork, UI code is readable and maintainable, and more. World-leading companies have used React and other JS technologies in some of the top market-defining products out there (Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook being the most vivid examples).

But let’s take a closer, more informed look at some particular reasons why use React and, more importantly, when to use React.js to tackle the most fitting goals and achieve outstanding results.

## Mature, simple-to-grasp dev workflow

One of the major reasons to use React.js for web development is the library’s ultimately optimized development interface and coding language. Thus, lightweight React’s API is reinforced with fast performance capacities to achieve a hassle-free, rapid development workflow. React components and concepts are really simple to figure out so there is not much learning curve here.

As opposed to other popular frameworks, like Vue and Angular, there is no barrage of extra HTML attributes (created when JavaScript is “crammed” into HTML - a standard practice for traditional frameworks and JS library solutions). In the long run, by putting JSX into JavaScript (literally going the other way round), React grants a much cleaner, better readable, more comprehensive code.

## Ultimate flexibility and compatibility

Using React.js for web development may come in extremely convenient because React is one of those cases where you get the hang of a single technology to easily reuse it across a range of platforms. And all due to being a library by nature, with the primary purpose of creating separate web design elements and components (anything from buttons and labels to grids and interactive features).

On top of that, there is a significant contribution by the extensive, long-established community. React’s current ecosystem is so vast that it enables developers to create desktop solutions and mobile applications, generate static websites, handle server rendering, and integrate advanced tech concepts (like VR and 360 views) with web solutions - all by similar, simple react web development guidelines and philosophies.

## Hassle-free reusability of components

We answer the ultimate question above - what is React.js used for in web development most particularly? For creating separate components. And this is exactly why created components can be easily reused. Once you’ve created a React.js web application element, you get a unique object that can be added to any other project compatible with the React-based code.

While a bigger general hierarchy is built out of those components (which are wrapped into higher-level components), each has a separate dedicated internal logic and rendering principle. This grants outstanding scaling opportunities helps to achieve much better React web app consistency and makes further support and optimization a piece of cake.
