first experience with Arduino boards. But it was a kind of
hobby until year 2019 that i began studying web programming with a
better purpose in mind. So that Node js was my pick, i have been
studying back-end frameworks like Express, and related libraries to
afford security and functionality, besides very useful concepts to
reuse logic such as middlewares and i have had experience working with
ORM or ODM to abstract databases such as Sequelize or Mongoose. I have
designed and abstracted databases for a System that will afford PKI
services in Cuba. `;

export const attached_2 = `React is open-sourced by Facebook just a shy a few years ago, itâ€™s
already become the number one choice for JavaScript devs around the
globe. And i have picked to work with this wonderful technology that
brings so many advantages. However Technology changes, and it changes
quickly. I am open-minded to new technologies in order to learn them
and then also take advantage of them. I currently use react libraries
such as react-hook-form, react-query, valtio, zustand,
styled-components and the popular react-router-dom.`;
