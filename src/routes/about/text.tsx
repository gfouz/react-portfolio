export const first_text = `Hello my name is Giovani, i began learning c++ in 2017 and it was my
first experience about this wonderful world. But it was a kind of hobby
until year 2019 that i began studying web programming with a better
purpose in mind than a hobby. So that Node js was my pick, i
have been very interested on back-end frameworks like Express, and
related libraries to afford security and functionality like Bcrypt and
jsonwebtoken besides very useful concepts to reuse logic as for
example middlewares, I enjoy to write code using these technologies.`;

export const second_text = `A friend of mind suggested me to study Vue in the beginning of
2021 and i accepted to do it, but after some months i was not so
convinced to use it because in my opinion i had found a better and more
explicit way to represent ui interfaces and i am talking about React.
I  soon  realized  of the great advantages that React offered me and
i still hold that opinion until now. Among my favorite libraries specially
made for react are react-query, react-hook-form, valtio for state
management, styled-components and others...`;

export const third_text = `I've been writing css code for over three years. I have always asked
myself about the good practices and how I could make my code more
readable, understandable, easy to maintain and to be handled by other
developers. We spend more time reading our code rather than writing it
because we always look for the element that we can modify, improve or
just to remember our-self how this or that element works. So, itâ€™s
important to write a good code in others words a clean, consistent, 
and a correct code. And BEM may help us to write that kind of css code.`;

export const fourth_text = `I have been attracted to English language since my childhood and this
has been a good investment for my life, because this has allowed me to
read great books and articles besides most of the content on the
internet is written in English. And it is the international language
of media and science. I can read, write or pronounce this beautiful
tongue with no much effort. it is a pleasure to do it.`;
